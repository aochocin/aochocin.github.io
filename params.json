  "body": "#Introduction\r\nHello, my name is Aurimas Ochocinskas and I was born in Olathe, Kansas as the youngest child of my family. I typically get straight A's in college by studying very hard for quizzes and tests. Whenever I have some free time from college, I like to play my favorite video games on the Playstation 4. The major that I'm currently pursuing is accounting since I work very well with numbers.\r\n\r\n### Contact Information\r\nBest way to contact me:\r\naochocin@stumail.jccc.edu\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\nTitle: March of the Snakes\r\n\r\nDescription: Use the polar bear to shoot bombs at incoming snakes.\r\n\r\nTools used: Greenfoot and Java\r\n\r\nLink: [March of the Snakes](https://github.com/aochocin/Programming-Fundamentals/tree/master/March-of-the-Snakes)\r\n\r\n\r\nTitle: Space Invaders\r\n\r\nDescription: Similar to my third programming assignment that was used as a guide to create my own game.\r\n\r\nTools used: Greenfoot and Java\r\n\r\nLink: [Space Invaders](https://github.com/aochocin/Programming-Fundamentals/tree/master/Space-Invaders)\r\n\r\n\r\nTitle: Frog and Fly\r\n\r\nDescription: This was the second programming assignment that I completed in Greenfoot.\r\n\r\nTools used: Greenfoot and Java\r\n\r\nLink: [Frog and Fly](https://github.com/aochocin/Programming-Fundamentals/tree/master/Frog-and-Fly)\r\n\r\n",
